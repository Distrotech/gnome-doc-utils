{"name":"Gnome-doc-utils","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/gnome-doc-utils","body":"ABOUT\r\n=====\r\ngnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the Gnome\r\nproject.  Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and\r\nall auxiliary files in your source tree, and it contains the DocBook\r\nXSLT stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp.  Starting with\r\nGnome 2.8, Yelp will require gnome-doc-utils for the XSLT.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n============\r\ntest/\r\n\tThe test directory contains a number of tests for gnome-doc-utils.\r\n\tDirectories of the form testdocn, where n is a positive integer,\r\n\tare skeleton source trees containing documentation, with the same\r\n\tlayout that would be used by actual projects.\r\n\r\n\tThe testdocs directory contains the unit tests from docbook-testdocs,\r\n\tdeveloped by Norm and Co. for the pan-galactic DocBook stylesheets.\r\n\tAn additional README file is in that directory, giving instructions\r\n\ton extending or changing any of the files in gnome-doc-utils CVS.\r\n\r\ndoc/\r\n\tThe doc directory contains documentation for gnome-doc-utils.  In\r\n\tmost cases, gnome-doc-utils is required to build its documentation.\r\n\tMechanisms are in place for bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nxslt/\r\n\tThe xslt directory contains all of the XSLT in gnome-doc-utils.\r\n\tNotably, the xslt/docbook directory contains the DocBook XSLT,\r\n\tand xslt/gettext contains the XSLT gettext utility for translating\r\n\tautomatic text.\r\n   \r\nsandbox/\r\n\tThe sandbox directory is not DISTed, so it will only appear if you\r\n\thave a CVS checkout.  It's a playground for new ideas.\r\n\r\nxml2po/\r\n\tThe xml2po directory contains the xml2po tool developed by Danilo\r\n\tSegan for translation of arbitrary XML formats.  It is used by\r\n\tgnome-doc-utils for DocBook translation.\r\n\r\nTESTING\r\n=======\r\nUnder the test directory are a number of tests for gnome-doc-utils.  To\r\ntest the build system (gnome-doc-utils.m4 and gnome-doc-utils.make), you\r\ncan use any of the testdocn (for n a positive integer) directories.  These\r\nare set up as skeleton source trees, behaving exactly as a real project\r\nwould.  Also, gnome-doc-utils uses itself to build its own documentation\r\n(under doc), so gnome-doc-utils itself is a test of the build tools.\r\n\r\nTo test the DocBook stylesheets, use the test/testdocs directory.  These\r\nunit tests are from the docbook-testdocs package on docbook.sourceforge.net,\r\ndeveloped by Norm and Co.  Simply typing make in that directory will build\r\neach test.  If the name of the test file is foo.001.xml, the output will be\r\nhtml/foo.001/foo.001.html.  Each test generally tests a small number of\r\nrelated DocBook elements.  Many of the features of DocBook or of the XSLT\r\nin gnome-doc-utils might not be tested by these.  Additional tests may\r\nbe added; follow the instructions in test/testdocs/README for that.\r\n\r\nAlso useful for testing the XSLT is to transform some large documents\r\nusing it.  The Gnome User Guide and the Gnumeric Manual both serve as\r\nexcellent test docs.\r\n\r\nHACKING\r\n=======\r\nUnlike most C programming, working on much of gnome-doc-utils really does\r\ninvolve isolated incremental improvements.  There's no way to give a short\r\nlist of broad features in a TODO list.\r\n\r\nTo work on the build tools (gnome-doc-utils.m4 and gnome-doc-utils.make),\r\nbuild the test docs and see what doesn't work.  gnome-doc-utils.make has\r\na list of all the high-level targets that should be fully supported.\r\n\r\nTo work on the DocBook XSLT, find an element that isn't implemented yet and\r\nimplement it.  If you have XML Starlet (xmlstar.sourceforge.net) installed, \r\nyou can type 'make report.html' in the xslt/docbook/html directory to get\r\na nice HTML report on what elements are implemented.  There is also a TODO\r\nfile in this directory with a very succinct list of matches that need to be\r\ndone that can't be caught by report.html.\r\n\r\nNote that the XSLT is documented inline with xsldoc, which is itself a part\r\nof gnome-doc-utils.  Feel free to work on xsldoc as well.  The documentation\r\ngenerated by xsldoc is included in the manual under doc/xslt.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, talk to Shaun McCance <shaunm@gnome.org>.  Never commit without\r\npermission, unless Shaun has told you otherwise.  Wash behind your ears.  Don't\r\ntake candy from strangers.  Support independant musicicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
