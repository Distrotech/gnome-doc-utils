  <title>Translating the Stylesheets</title>
  <para>The GNOME documentation stylesheets use two different mechanisms for
  internationalization.  The simpler method is provided by
  <filename>gettext.xsl</filename>.  This method reads in translated strings
  from a simple <filename>l10n.xml</filename> file, which is easily managed
  using PO files and <command>intltool</command>.  The other method is
  provided by <filename>format2xsl.xsl</filename>.  This method converts
  special format files to XSLT stylesheets at build time.  It is considerably
  more flexible than the <filename>gettext</filename> method, as it allows
  translators programmer-level control over the formatted output.</para>

  <para>Generally, the <filename>gettext</filename> method is used only
  for simple string lookups that require no special formatting.  However,
  since it tends to have better performance than the
  <filename>format2xsl</filename> method, it is preferred whenever
  possible.  If you are providing translations and find that a string marked
  for translation is insufficient for your locale, you should request to have
  that translation reworked using <filename>format2xsl</filename>.  Document
  processing is a much more difficult task for internationalization than most
  simple application translations in GNOME.  The maintainers don't know all
  the nuances of document processing in every language, so the only way we
  can improve the internationalization support is with the help of the
  translators.</para>
