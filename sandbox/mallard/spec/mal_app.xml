<title>Application Names</title>

<synopsis><code mime="application/relax-ng-compact-syntax">
mal_app = element app {
  <link xref="mal_link#ubiquitous">mal_link_attr</link>?,
  <link xref="mal_inline#simple">mal_inline_simple</link>+
}
</code></synopsis>

<p>The <code>app</code> element marks the human-readable name of an
application.  It should not be used to mark the name of the command
used to run an application; use <code xref="mal_cmd">cmd</code> for
this purpose instead.</p>

  <p>Application names are usually nouns, and are often a common word
  or phrase that are indicative of their functionality.  Frequently,
  they are simply the name of what the application is.  In English and
  many other languages, the use of an application name in a sentence
  may sound like the author has simply mistakenly omitted an article
  if the application name is not understood to be a title.</p>

  <p>For example, the calculator application that comes with GNOME is
  called <app>Calculator</app>.  If an author were to write <quote>To
  start <app>Calculator</app>…</quote>, then a reader may confuse this
  for <quote>To start the calculator…</quote> with an error.  This is
  even more pronounced in languages like German, where nouns are always
  capitalized.</p>

  <p>For this reason, it is recommended that application names marked
  with the <code>app</code> element are rendered in italics are using
  some other font variation.</p>
