xml2po regression tests
.......................

This is a collection of regression tests.  They're not distributed,
but are only used for checking changes in xml2po behaviour. 

To run, try 

  ./test.py 2>/dev/null

(stderr redirection in order to avoid seeing "Warning: image not
found" messages; there should be NO OUTPUT at all if all tests are
successful!)

Simple tests are consisted of four files: original XML file, PO
Template (untranslated PO file), PO file (translated) and translated
XML file.  You add all these files with the same basename, and only
change extension, i.e.

  test.xml
  test.pot
  test.po
  test.xml.out

On all of these, xml2po is run without any arguments that modify
behaviour.

Complex/other tests are represented by a pair of subdirectory and
script name to execute in that subdirectory.
